Title: R genetic programming framework
Description: RGP is a simple modular Genetic Programming (GP) system build in pure R. In addition to general GP tasks, the system supports Symbolic Regression by GP through the familiar R model formula interface. GP individuals are represented as R expressions, an (optional) type system enables domain-specific function sets containing functions of diverse domain- and range types. A basic set of genetic operators for variation (mutation and crossover) and selection is provided.
